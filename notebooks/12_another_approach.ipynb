         "Investors in Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the A options chain for the new August 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of A, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.99/share today.\nBecause the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.60% return on the cash commitment, or 5.45% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of A stock at the current price level of $138.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.75% if the stock gets called away at the August 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if A shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Agilent Technologies, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing A's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $138.99) to be 27%.

         "Fintel reports that on December 13, 2023, Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.\nAnalyst Price Forecast Suggests 1.04% Downside\nAs of November 27, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 132.34. The forecasts range from a low of 101.00 to a high of $157.50. The average price target represents a decrease of 1.04% from its latest reported closing price of 133.74.\nSee our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.\nThe projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 4.35%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.\nAgilent Technologies Declares $0.24 Dividend\nOn November 15, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share ($0.94 annualized). Shareholders of record as of January 2, 2024 will receive the payment on January 24, 2024. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.\nAt the current share price of $133.74 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.71%.\nLooking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.72%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.14 (n=235).\nThe current dividend yield is 0.12 standard deviations below the historical average.\nAdditionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.\nThe company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.22%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.\nWhat is the Fund Sentiment?\nThere are 1945 funds or institutions reporting positions in Agilent Technologies. This is an increase of 30 owner(s) or 1.57% in the last quarter. Average portfolio weight of all funds dedicated to A is 0.31%, a decrease of 2.75%. Total shares owned by institutions increased in the last three months by 1.25% to 300,740K shares.\nThe put/call ratio of A is 1.01, indicating a bearish outlook.\nWhat are Other Shareholders Doing?\nMassachusetts Financial Services holds 11,076K shares representing 3.79% ownership of the company.

         "In recent trading, shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $132.36, changing hands for $133.74/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\nThere are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.00. The standard deviation is $12.779.\nBut the whole reason to look at the average A price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with A crossing above that average target price of $132.36/share, investors in A have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $132.36 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

         "When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised. There are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agilent Technologies, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average."

         "Agilent Technologies A is enhancing its BioTek product line on the back of portfolio expansions and technology upgrades.\n\nNotably, Agilent enhanced the BioTek Cytation C10 confocal imaging reader with the addition of water immersion and confocal spinning disk technology.\n\nFurther, the water immersion technology can be used in light microscopy to increase numerical aperture, reduce z-axis distortion, and improve image quality by placing water between the objective lens and sample.\n\nAdditionally, the technology aids researchers in reducing exposure times in live-cell applications, thereby reducing the traditional phototoxic effects associated with these experiments.\n\nMoreover, this addition offers a deep-sectioning spinning disk technology, enhancing microscopic images by blocking out-of-focus light, resulting in clearer, more quantitative results.\n\nAgilent is anticipated to gain significant traction among researchers utilizing live-cell and 3D applications on the back of its latest move.\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Agilent Technologies, Inc. Quote\nGrowth Prospects\nThe latest move positions the company well to strengthen its footing in the global microplate reader and live cell imaging markets.\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global microplate reader market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period 2023-2030.\n\nA Mordor Intelligence report indicates the global live cell imaging market size will reach $2.95 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.06% between 2023 and 2028.\n\nWe believe the company’s solid prospects in these promising markets are expected to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from macroeconomic uncertainties, weak momentum in China, rising inflationary pressure and geo-political tensions.\n\nAgilent has lost 13.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 0.9%.\nACG Segment in Focus\nThe latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) segment.\n\nNotably, Agilent Technologies launched Gen6 software for all Agilent BioTek detection instruments, offering automated optimization tools and improved navigation through built-in data analysis functions.\n\nFurther, the company introduced the Agilent BioTek 406 FX washer dispenser, a compact tool that combines reagent dispensing and plate-washing, suitable for automated systems and benchtop use.\n\nAll the abovementioned endeavors are likely to aid the performance of the ACG segment in the days ahead.\n\nIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the ACG segment revenues increased 6% year over year to $404 million, accounting for 24% of total revenues.\n\nOur model projects fiscal 2024 ACG segment revenues at $1.64 billion, indicating growth of 4.7% from 2022.\n\nStrong momentum in the underlined segment will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Badger Meter BMI, Arista Networks ANET and Adobe ADBE. While Badger Meter currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Arista Networks and Adobe carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of Badger Meter have gained 37.8% in the year-to-date period.
